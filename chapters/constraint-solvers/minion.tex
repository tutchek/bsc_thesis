\section{Minion}

Minion is a constraint solver which works as a standalone application. Minion takes
as an input the problem description and returns the solutions if there are any.
Minion is open source and available at sourceforge.net. The problem description
is contained in a file with special format. The file contains definitions of variables,
their domains and constraints on them. The best description of the input format could
be "the constraint assembly language". The constraints cannot use as their parameters 
expressions. If we need to costrain the expression we have to introduce new variable
to be equal to the expression and then constrain this variable. For example let assume 
we can use constraints $X = |Y|$ and $X < Y$ and we need to use constraint $X < |Y|$.
We have to introduce the auxiliary variable $a$ and post two constraints $a = |Y|$ and
 $X < a$. If we use many expressions in our problem it leads to enormous number of
 auxiliary variables. Moreover the language does not contain loops. Therefore we
 cannot post various number of constraints based on the size parameter of the model.
 We have to state all constraints for given problem instance. As a result the definition
 of 4-queens problem cannot be easily transformed to 8-queens problem. The set of constraint
 is limited and cannot be extended. Moreover some basic constraints have to be used in unusual way.
 If we want to constrain $a = \sum{w_i x_i}$ we have to use pair of constraints
 $a \leq \sum{w_i x_i}$, $a \geq \sum{w_i x_i}$ since the variant with equal sign
 is not in the system. The used variable can be boolean, bounded integers, discrete integers
 and sparse bounded integers. Bool variable is a variable with domain $\{0,1\}$.
 Bounded integer variable is integer variable where the solver stores only its bounds.
 Discrete itegers are generally the same as bounded integers except it can contain 
 holes in the intrval. Finally sparse bounded integers are variables which have small
 amount of non consecutive values specified in the file. During the computation
 only bounds of the spare bounded integers are updated.  
 
The input format is not very human-friendly. Even form small problems the amount of
auxiliary variables grows over reasonable limits and the input is not easy to understand.
It is a reasonable solution to use a generator to generate a minion input file.
User can either write his own ad hoc generator for his problem or use tool like
Tailor which is described in the section \ref{tailor}.

\subsection{Solver description}
As stated in previous section Minion is a standalone executable which takes as a parameter
filename of the input file or through the standard input the contents of input.
It automaticaly starts computation and writes on the standard output or into the
specified file solutions. It can handle only integers and therefore the problem have to
be encoded in a such way. Format of the input file is not stable but uses an identifier
which prevets from misinterpretation of the input. If the user feed the Minion with 
an unsupported format of the file the solver informs about that and ends. Current version
of the input file is 3, and user can recognize it by observing first line of the input, which
has to contain only string \texttt{MINION 3}. After this identification line follows in any order
with no limit on repeating the sections of the file. The file can contain the following sections:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Definition of the variables
  \item Definition of the tupples
  \item Definition of the constraints
  \item Definition of the search parameter
\end{itemize}

The list of supported variables can be found in the table \ref{podporovane-podminky}.
The search engine behavior can be adjusted either in the input file or at the command line
by parameters. User can adjust the order of variables during the selection phase of search,
whether solve all solutions or only one or how to format the output.
 
\subsection{Debugging support}
Minion offers printing out the search tree where one can observe the solvers actions.
However other tool than this printout is not available. Since the modelling in Minion
is difficult user will probably use the Tailor tool. Tailor offers not only translation
to the Minion format but direct invocation of the Minion, passing the input to it and
show the solution. User then can directly modify the Essence source code and perform
the invokation again if the results are not what he expected. 

\subsection{Subjektivní hodnocení solveru}
The authors stated on the Minion website that Minion is the fastest available solver.
We will leave it to the readers consideration. e found out that even for large problem 
instances if the memory was sufficient the anwer was given immediately. The biggest 
problem is then the inout format but this can be resolved by using the Tailor tool.
As a standalone executable which can be called from command line it can even bring 
the constraint solving capability to programs written in languages like bash. The only
thing which is needed is the capability to assemble the input format. As a documentation 
there is available 

Autoøi na stránkách solveru uvádí, ¾e je Minion nejrychlej¹í solver, který je k 
dispozici. Toto necháme na posouzení ètenáøi po vlastních pokusech se systémem pøípadnì
po zhodnocení výsledkù na¹ich benchmarkù. Rozhodnì se ukázalo, ¾e v pøípadì kdy systému
nedojde pamì» z dùvodu velikosti problému, je i pro velké instance problému schopen 
okam¾ité odpovìdi. Nejvìt¹í pøeká¾kou je tedy vstupní formát, ale tento problém je 
elegantnì øe¹itelný zmínìným programem Tailor. Jako samostatný program, který je
mo¾né zavolat s definicí problému a on na standardní výstup vrátí øe¹ení je pou¾itelný
jako øe¹iè i pro takové programy jako napøíklad Bash skripty. Jediný po¾adavek na 
pou¾ití je schopnost sestavit vstupní soubor. Co se týèe dokumentace, je k dispozici
referenèní pøíruèka, která obsahuje popis v¹ech podmínek a vstupního formátu souboru.
Také je souèástí pøíruèky jemný úvod do pøevodu CSP modelu na vstupní soubor Minionu.
