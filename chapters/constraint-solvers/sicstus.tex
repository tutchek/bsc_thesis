\section{SICStus Prolog}

SICStus Prolog is an implementation of the Prolog programming language by Swedish
Institue of Computer Science or SICS. It differs from the other here discussed solvers 
because SICStus Prolog is not a free open source system. The trial version of this
system can be obtained. Just like the \eclipse system the SICStus Prolog is not only
a constraint solver but a programming language where constraint solver is shipped as 
an independent library. The system provides libraries for solving the constraint problems
over the finite domains, over the boolean domains and over the real domains.

\section{Solver description}
Simillary as in the \eclipse system the solvers are independent libraries shipped 
with the system. The constraint solver over the finite domain consist of the
{\em clp(fd)} library \cite{Carlsson97anopen-ended}. The language constructs are different
compared to \eclipse; however, the basic properties are preserved. Therefore porting
the \eclipse program to SICStus Prolog is not a hard work but also it is not trivial.
The number of available constraints is higher than the \eclipse system provides.
The clp(fd)library offers standard arithmetic expressions, the relation constraints
and the global constraints. The library also provides the scheduling constraints and 
the extensional constraints.

The {\em clp(b)} provides a solver over the boolean variables. The solver contains
the relation constraints as well as constraints for the tautology and satisfiability.
Finally the {\em clp(q,r)} library \cite{clpqr:opai} provides constraining of the

The standard set of constraints can be expanded by user defined constraints. As well as the
\eclipse system the SICStus Prolog offers to add constraints using the Constraint Handling
Rules language and FlatZinc language. User can also define his own constraints as the
Prolog predicate. The user created constraint can be either a global constraint or
a primitive constraint. The ways how to create such constraints are described in 
the SICStus Prolog manual.

\section{Debugging support}
The SICStus Prolog offers the {\em Finite Domain Constraint Debugger} or {\em fdbg} library.
This library can be used next to the standard Prolog debugging predicate \texttt{trace}. This
predicate allows to debug any prolog program. The {\em fdbg} library provides the
log of the constraint propagation and distribution. There are logged all changes to the
domains and other events which occured during the computation. The example of the {\em fdbg}
output is in the figure \ref{sicstus:fdbg}. On the first line there is a Prolog query.
We constrain the variable $X$ to be in the domain $\{5,...,9\}$ and the variable $Y$
to be in domain $\{1,...,6\}$. Then we constrain the variable $X$ to be smaller than
variable $Y$. We did not perform the search so the variables remains not solved.
User can set names for the variables to achieve a better orientation in the printout.

    fdvar_10 = 1..6 -> {6}
