\eclipse is an open source implementation of Prolog programming language. \eclipse
is provided with libraries for constraint solving. It is possible to solve models 
over integers, real numbers and finite integer sets. The solver is not just one library
but there is one general solver and several specialised solvers. Basic solver is
the {\em ic} library -- interval constraints which contains basic arithmetic constraints.
For global constraints there is a {\em ic\_global} library. Global constraints are constraints
which use some more advanced techniques to filter the variable domain, for example 
the \texttt{alldifferent} constraint implemented as a matching in a bipartite graph.
The ic library contains the alldifferent constraint too, but the one introduced in
ic\_global library is stronger. For scheduling problems there is an {\em ic\_cumulative}
library and for finite integer sets {\em ic\_sets} library.
