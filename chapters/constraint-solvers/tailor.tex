Tailor is not an constraint solver. It is an open source Essence compiler which can produce input
format of the Minion solver, C++ source using Gecode as a solver and input format of Gecode/FlatZinc.
Tailor is a Java application, which can be run either interactively as well as a
command line utility. Tailor takes as an input Essence program and Essence parameters file.
Then it normalize the input to one source code. After normalization it performs the 
flattening of the code. In flattening phase it removes all foreach loops and sums
and replaces them by introducing new auxiliary variables and by repeating of the 
basic constraints. Finally it transforms this normalized code to the destination
language. Tailor offers tuning the output code by setting several parameters about
the language coonstruct which can be used. Tailor offers directly run the solver
from its environment on the translated source code.
