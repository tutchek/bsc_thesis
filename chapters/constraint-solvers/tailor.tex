Tailor is not a constraint solver. It is an open source Essence compiler which produces an input
format of the Minion solver, a C++ source for the Gecode solver or an input format of Gecode/FlatZinc.
Tailor is a Java application, which can be run either interactively, or as a
command line utility. Tailor accepts as an input both an Essence program and an Essence parameters file.
Then it normalizes the input into one source code. After normalization it performs the 
flattening of the code. During the flattening phase it replaces all the foreach loops and the sums
with new auxiliary variables and with repeated basic constraints. Finally, it transforms this normalized 
code to a target language. Moreover, one can tune up the output of the Tailor solver by setting up several 
parameters about the language constructs which can be used. Another feature, which Tailor has, is that one 
can run the solver directly from its environment over the translated source code.
