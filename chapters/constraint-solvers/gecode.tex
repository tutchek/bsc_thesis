\section{Gecode}

Gecode is a C++ library for solving constraint problems. It allows to
model a problem which contains integers, boolean variables and finite integer sets. Gecode
is a free open source software just like most of the mentioned solvers are. The library is
distributed in the source codes and for the Microsoft Windows there is also an installer with
precompiled libraries. Optionally, an user needs a Qt library, which is used in 
a visualization graphic tool Gist. Apart from the basic constraints, Gecode has also 
constraints for scheduling, finite automatons, graphs and so on. We describe those
constraints further in the following section. The key person behind the Gecode 
solver is Christian Schulte, who also participated in a development of the system Mozart/Oz. 

\subsection{Solver description}
A problem is modeled as a class inherited from a class Space. In this particular class
there are defined variables and constraints. The variables are objects of one of the following types:
IntVar for integers, BoolVar for booleans and SetVar for finite integer sets. 
Compared to the other solvers the boolean variables aren't just integers with a domain $\{0,1\}$.
It is not even allowed to declare a constraint $b=i$ having a boolean variable $b$ and an integer $i$.
When a relation between the boolean and integer variables is required, one can use either reified constraints
 $(i = 1) \Leftrightarrow (b = true)$, or channelling constraints $(b_j = 1) \Leftrightarrow (i = j)$ (such as $b = (0,0,0,1,0,0)$, $i = 3$).
The constraints are global functions in a Gecode namespace. To add a constraint to the model
one has to use the \texttt{post} function which takes a constraint as a parameter.
Due to the function overriding, most of the constraints are implemented in a way, 
where there are more variants each available through the overriding; and the appropriate one is chosen.
If the users uses a so-called {\em minimodel}, they can use short expressions,
for instance a constraint $a = x \cdot y$ can be written as \texttt{post(home, a == x*y )} instead of \texttt{mult(home,x,y,a)}; 
however, the minimodel works only as a ``syntactic sugar" and, therefore, it does not come up 
with any new constraints and it only ease a way how the current ones are written. 

Apart from the standard arithmetic constraints and order constraints, Gecode offers
wide range of specialized constraints. For SAT there is a constraint \texttt{clause(space,rel,x,y,z)},
which is equal to a condition $\bigvee {x_i} \vee \bigvee{\neg y_i} = z$, respectively, $\bigwedge {x_i} \wedge \bigwedge{\neg y_i} = z$
depending on a parameter {\em rel}. There is another interesting constraint {\em count}, which 
guarantees that $\#\{i|x_i = j\} = y_j$ is satisfied. This brings us to the fact
that the benchmark Magic sequence can be modeled and implemented by using only one constraint \texttt{count(*this, x, x)}.
Moreover, there are also available the extensional constraints. Those are constraints defined 
using of the extension, for example, a deterministic finite automaton. In such a case, the constraint
has the following pattern:  {\em $x$ is a word, which is accepted by the automaton $A$}. As for graph constraints, 
Gecode has a constraint {\em $x$ is a Hamiltonian cycle}. For an area of scheduling, there is available
a constraint \texttt{cumulatives(home, resource, start, duration, end, height, limit, atmost)}, which
gu\-arantees, that in a set of tasks T (task $T_i = \langle \mathrm{machine}_i, \mathrm{start}_i,
\mathrm{duration}_i, \mathrm{end}_i,\\ \mathrm{height}_i \rangle$) will be performed on 
the available machines. Each machine can handle at most $\mathrm{limit}_j$ tasks at
one moment.

The following constraints can be used for constraining of the set variables: standard 
set operations, constraints for cardinality of set and a constraint
which guarantees, that a weighed sum of set has a given value. That means if we have a set $x$, 
a weight vector $w$ and the total should be $y$, the constraint has a pattern $\sum{x_i w_i} = y$. 
Furthermore, there are two constraints available, both of which are related to convexity. A set is convexed, 
if it contains a continual interval of numbers. A set $\{1,2,3\}$ is convex, but $\{1,3,4,5\}$ is not 
convex, since it does not contain the number 2. The convex hull is the least convex superset. A constraint
\texttt{convex(home,x)} guarantees, that $x$ is convex and \texttt{convex(home,x,y)} means, that $y$ is a convex hull for $x$.
If one needs to model an optimization problem, the problem representing class is derived from a class MaximizeSpace (or MinimizeSpace)
instead of a class Space. In the class there has to be implemented the \texttt{cost} function which returns
the value of the objective function. 

Searching is maintained by a function \texttt{branch(home,x,var,val)}, which sets a search vector $x$. While distributing,
a parameter $var$ defines an algorithm for choosing a variable and a parameter $val$ defines an algorithm
for choosing of a value of variable on which depends the distribution. The following code shows the call interface
for the application to invoke a search for the solution: 

\begin{verbatim}
Model* m = new Model;	
SEARCH<Model> e(m);
delete m;

while (Model* s = e.next())
{
	s->print();
	delete s;
}  
\end{verbatim}

A model is a class derived from a class Space or, respectively, MaximizeScript, which
represents a model of CSP. In the real application the \texttt{SEARCH} must be changed to one of the followings:
\texttt{DFS} -- the depth-first left-most search, \texttt{LDS} -- the limited discrepancy,
\texttt{BAB} -- the branch-and-bound algorithm and finally \texttt{Restart} -- the depth-first left-most
restart search. Both algorithms \texttt{BAB} a \texttt{Restart} can be used when 
searching an optimal solution. All of the algorithms can be used for a parallel computation.
Having a computer with more CPUs, one can reach much faster computation.

\subsection{Debugging support}
In Gecode there is a tool Gist, which visualizes a search tree. It is a tool quite 
similar to the tool Explorer in Mozart/Oz solver. The interface, graphic symbols and
functions are the same as in Explorer. On the other hand, Gist gives us an additional 
function {\em Gist node statistics}, which gives us more information about a specific node 
of the search tree, such as the depth of the node (according to a tree root), current height
of the node's subtree and the number of successful/unsuccessful solutions in the subtree.
In Gist there is also a tool Inspector, which works equally to the Inspector in Mozart/Oz.
   

\subsection{Subjective description}
Gecode is a typical example of a top software, which can be totally unusable due to
the absence of a documentation. Before the version 3.0.0, which was released in March 2009, there
was only a technical documentation generated by Doxygen. Furthermore, the example models were 
sealed into a pattern class Example to achieve a more simple call of the examples; however, it lacked any further 
explanations how to implement the solver inside own project and it was necessary to deeply
examine the source code of the solver. Since the version 3.0.0 being released, there is
available an e-book Modelling with Gecode \cite{gecode:modelling}, which has completely changed
the situation. The e-book is a tutorial, which step by step guides the reader from a basic 
query -- from a given problem construct a model for the solver -- to wide range of possibilities
of setting up the solver. Apart from the classical documentation, there is also an e-mail conference,
which is -- while writing this thesis -- quite a great place to ask and where the authors
answer after a short period.
