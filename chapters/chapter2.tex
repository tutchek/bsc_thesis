\section{\eclipse}

\subsection{Description}

\eclipse is open source constraint satisfaction solving system based on Prolog 
programming language. It is available for Microsoft Windows NT family, 
Linux 32bit/64bit, MacOS and SunOS Sparc platforms. The system is based on the Prolog programming
language which is extended bz new predicates and operators. Prolog extensions are 
more described in "Modelling Capabilities" subsection. In general it can be said that \eclipse
system tends to be SICStus Prolog compatible. \eclipse provides grafical interface,
methods to communicate with hosting operating system or via network. 

As stated in \cite{wiki:Eclipse} \eclipse is developed until 1995 at the European 
Computer-Industry Research Centre in Munich and then until 2005 at the Centre for 
Planning and Resource Control at Imperial College London. It is currently copyrighted by 
Cisco Systems. In September 2006, it was released as open source software under 
the Cisco Systems|Cisco-style MPL, equivalent to the Mozilla Public License.

In the time of writing this thesis it is available in version 5.10 which is benchmarked.

\section{Choco}

\subsection{Short description}

Choco is java library for solving CSP distributed as jar archive. Therefore it can
be used in every Java program which allows easily integrate CSP solver to applications.
Project is available at Sourceforge where user can found sources, documentation (in 
JavaDoc and wiki system with several tutorials) and binaries (compiled jar archive).

Beacuse Choco is is Java library, it does not need its own IDE and compiler. User can
use for example Eclipse IDE or other java development tool by his preference.

\section{Minion}

\subsection{Description}

Minion is very low level CSP system with strictly limited set of commands. One 
can describe programming in minion as "constraint satisfaction machine language".
As an example we can demonstrate in on the 4-queens problem.

Common description is:

\begin{align}
\forall i,j, i \neq j & : Q_i \neq Q_j \\
\forall i,j, i < j & : | Q_i - Q_j | \neq j - i 
\end{align}

However in minion there has to be twelve auxiliary variables. Minion does not 
support "sum is equal". If user want to achieve "sum is equal" constraint it has 
to be modified from


Also there is nothing like for or while cycles, whole problem has to be defined in
the input file, which makes programming in pure minion really difficult and nearly
impossible to scale because of growing of auxiliary variables.

The 4-queen problem then looks as follows

\begin{equation*}
\begin{gathered}
Q_2 - Q_3 \leq a_0 \\
Q_1 - Q_3 \leq a_2 \\
Q_1 - Q_2 \leq a_4 \\
Q_0 - Q_3 \leq a_6 \\
Q_0 - Q_2 \leq a_8 \\
Q_0 - Q_1 \leq a_{10}
\end{gathered} \qquad \begin{gathered}
Q_2 - Q_3 \geq a_0 \\
Q_1 - Q_3 \geq a_2 \\
Q_1 - Q_2 \geq a_4 \\
Q_0 - Q_3 \geq a_6 \\
Q_0 - Q_2 \geq a_8 \\
Q_0 - Q_1 \geq a_{10}
\end{gathered} \qquad \begin{gathered}
| a_0 | = a_1 \\
| a_2 | = a_3 \\
| a_4 | = a_5 \\
| a_6 | = a_7 \\
| a_8 | = a_9 \\
| a_{10} | = a_{11}
\end{gathered} \qquad \begin{gathered}
a_{11} \neq 1 \\
a_9 \neq 2 \\
a_7 \neq 3 \\
a_5 \neq 3 \\
a_1 \neq 1 \\
\text{alldifferent}(Q_1,Q_2,Q_3,Q_4)
\end{gathered}
\end{equation*}

As one can see, the problem is described strictly for four queens variant. If there is 
need to extend number of queens whole problem description has to be rewriten.

Fortunately there exists java program Tailor by Andrea Rendl. Tailor converts program
written in Essence' programming language to input format of Minion. Essence' is solver
independent language which describe CSP. More information about this programming language
can be found in \cite{constraints:essence}. Essence' defines syntactic sugar constructions
like \verb=forall= (abbreviation for $a_1 \mand a_2 \mand a_3 \mand \dots$), 
\verb=exists= (abbreviation for $a_1 \mor a_2 \mor a_3 \mor \dots$), \verb=sum= and others.

Great advantage compared to standard Minion input is possibility to scale problems
with given variable. In Minion, the input file can specify for example 4-queens problem 
but for other number of queens is the file unuseful. Programs in Essence' can be written
using constants which are substituted during translation to Minion input format.
As an example of Essence' program we will show 4-queens problem in figure \ref{essence-source-4queens} 
on page \pageref{essence-source-4queens}.  

\begin{figure}
\caption{\label{essence-source-4queens}Example of 4-queens program in Essence'}
\begin{verbatim}
language ESSENCE' 1.b.a

find queens: matrix indexed by [int(1..n)] of int(1..n)

such that

forall i: int(1..n). forall j: int(i+1..n).

  | queens[i] - queens[j] | != | i - j |,

  alldiff(queens)
  
letting n to be 4
\end{verbatim}
\end{figure}

During translation Tailor normalize Essence' program then converts it to flat Essence'.
Flat Essence' is programm in essence which does not contain any syntactic sugar structures.
This program is then converted to Minion input format.

Tailor is written in Java and is distributed as JAR package. It provides graphic interface
with editor of Essence' code. User can directly convert program in Essence' to Minion
and then run it and see the result if any. Tailor can be also used as non-interactive 
tool which only converts from Essence' to Minion.
