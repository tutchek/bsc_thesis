\chapter{Contents of the CD}
\label{cdcontents}

We include a CD with additional content to the thesis. On the included CD one can 
find the installation files of the discussed solvers except SICStus Prolog. Also we 
put there full source code of the benchmarks implemented in all solvers including minion input files.
An electronic copy of this thesis can be found there in the PDF format.

The content of the CD is available at http://www.tulacek.eu/bc\_thesis/
